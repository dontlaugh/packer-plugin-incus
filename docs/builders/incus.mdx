# Incus Builder

Type: `incus`
Artifact BuilderId: `incus`

The `incus` Packer builder builds containers for Incus. The builder starts an Incus
container, runs provisioners within this container, then saves the container as
an Incus image.

The Incus builder requires the `incus-client` package.

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example.

**HCL**

```hcl
source "incus" "lxd-xenial" {
  image = "ubuntu-daily:xenial"
  output_image = "ubuntu-xenial"
  publish_properties {
    description = "Trivial repackage with Packer"
  }
}

build {
  sources = ["lxd.lxd-xenial"]
}
```

**JSON**

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "lxd",
      "name": "lxd-xenial",
      "image": "ubuntu-daily:xenial",
      "output_image": "ubuntu-xenial",
      "publish_properties": {
        "description": "Trivial repackage with Packer"
      }
    }
